2. **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**: The average revenue generated from each customer.
3. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: The direct costs associated with producing and operating the product.
4. **Gross Margin**: The company's gross profit margin.

## 4. Key Results
| **Metric**                          | **Result**     | **Comment**                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** | 1,213.97 USD   | Higher than the SaaS industry average (\$200–\$700). The customer acquisition cost needs optimization to improve efficiency. |
| **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)** | 284.36 USD     | ARPU is low compared to CAC, but still acceptable for a SaaS model if the company can retain customers long enough.          |
| **Gross Margin**                    | 75.60%         | High margin, within the ideal range for SaaS (70–80%), indicating effective operations.                                      |
| **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**   | 211,551.59 USD | LTV far exceeds CAC, demonstrating a sustainable business model with excellent customer retention.                           |

## 5. Actionable Recommendations (Concise)
- **Reduce CAC**: Optimize marketing channels, focus on high-conversion channels, and cut inefficient costs.
- **Increase ARPU**: Develop premium packages, upsell, cross-sell, and encourage service upgrades.
- **Maintain Gross Margin**: Control operating costs, optimize cloud systems to keep the margin above 75%.
- **Monitor LTV/CAC**: Regularly track to ensure the ratio stays above 3.
